# Speed Reader server

I built an app called [Speed Reader](http://m-tambo.com/speed-reader) which accepts a URL and spits back some speed metrics for that URL. </br>
This is a Node server which facilitates that, using a handy scraper called [NighmareJS](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare).

## Update

I abandoned this version due to some difficulty deploying to Heroku. </br >
View the current version [here](https://github.com/m-tambo/speed-reader-heroku)
