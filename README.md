# Speed Reader server
I built an app called [Speed Reader](https://github.com/m-tambo/speed-reader) which accepts a URL and spits back some speed metrics for that URL. </br>
This is a Node server which facilitates that, using a handy scraper called [NighmareJS](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare)
